# AppFUMO PartitionUpdater source-integrity and target-selection boundary

Status: exact-static, execution-free analysis of the recovered embedded FUMO
ELF. No updater, helper, or recovered target code was run. No update input,
package, image, mount, write, slot change, boot action, or persistence action was
created or attempted.

## Result

The reviewed `PartitionUpdater` route has two materially different modes.
When global mode byte `0x6d20b4` is nonzero, the orchestrator emits its
integrity-check signal; the constructor's hash-bound signal/slot identities and
generated metadata tail jump `0x16ba9c -> 0xcd640` bind that route to
`slotHashCheck`. When the byte is zero, the same orchestrator tail-jumps directly
to `startPartitionUpdate` at `0xce110 -> 0xc53d0` after its ordinary setup
checks.

In the hash-gated route, `slotHashCheck` verifies the selected primary source
when that candidate is present and verifies each non-excluded entry source
pathname. The complete direct-call inventory for source gate `0xc1ff0` is only
`0xcd6fa` and `0xcdbae`, both inside `slotHashCheck`. Each nonzero result takes a
failure path; only loop completion reaches post-hash starter `0xcd560`, whose
sole direct caller is `0xcdea7` and which tail-jumps to the writer at `0xcd5db`.
A mismatch therefore does not reach the write starter through this reviewed
route.

This is **pre-write source authentication**, not final-partition integrity.
Verifier and writer receive the same stored `QString` pathname value from record
field `+0x10`, but independently reopen it. No retained descriptor or open
object binds the verifier's bytes to the writer's bytes. Exact same-object,
same-byte, transformed-output, and final-partition identity remain unknown.

The static map and active/inactive helper functions are present and hash-bound.
The writer finds a selected record by field `+0x20` and consumes target field
`+0x28`; image-backed and clone branches are distinct. The exact end-to-end
assignment from a particular inactive-helper return object into the selected
runtime record instance is not closed by the reviewed instructions, so the
report marks that link unknown. No operational device mapping is published.
Bootloader activation and mark-good are separate and unresolved.

The process-completion handler, fstab-state updater, and finalization FDEs have
no direct call or jump to any inventoried file-signature/source-hash target
`0x45820`, `0x45d80`, `0x18f700`, `0x140f50`, or `0xc1ff0`. This proves only a
bounded direct-edge negative for those exact FDEs and targets. It does not
exclude indirect, virtual, external, inlined, loader, boot-stage, or dynamically
invoked verification. Process completion is not cryptographic readback, and
final partition byte identity remains unknown.

The analyzer also binds the exact executable-file identities and version line of
both LLVM tools. Addresses below are link-time virtual addresses in the
image-base-zero embedded ELF namespace.

Support FDEs for the fixed-key verifier, signed-trailer parser, record/key
verification, process-thread starter, and generated metadata dispatcher are
also bound in the strict report.

## Verifier format: bounded claims only

The source gate checks source-file existence, runs its first hash/status stage,
and, on zero status, calls the fixed-public-key verifier at `0xc22eb`. That
verifier constructs its key pathname from two hash-bound literals, reads the
key file, and calls record/key verifier `0x18f700` over the supplied source
pathname.

The signed-file parser seeks to `file_size - 0x4024`, allocates and reads exactly
`0x4024` bytes, and recognizes two three-byte header families: `TER` and `TE2`.
It does not test a four-byte `TER2` literal. Internal record verification contains
a 32-byte comparison and linked mbedTLS operations, but this package does not
bind the exact signed byte ranges, the digest algorithm for this route, or RSA
padding/signature encoding. Those fields are `null` rather than inferred.

## Complete selected direct-transfer inventories

The strict manifest records calls and direct/tail jumps separately. Critical
inventories are:

- source-integrity gate `0xc1ff0`: calls `0xcd6fa`, `0xcdbae`; no direct jumps;
- write starter `0xc53d0`: call `0xcc646`; tail jumps `0xcd5db`, `0xce110`;
- post-hash starter `0xcd560`: call `0xcdea7` only;
- slot-hash slot `0xcd640`: generated metadata tail jump `0x16ba9c` only;
- completion handler `0xcf9b0`: generated metadata tail jump `0x16ba28` only;
- fstab updater `0xd0c80`: call `0xd2400` only;
- finalization `0xd1e70`: no direct calls or jumps to its entry.

The last row is important: finalization is a mapped FDE, but this direct
inventory does not prove its dynamic invoker or that every completion path
reaches it.

## Trust-boundary model

| Boundary | Exact-static result |
|---|---|
| pre-write source authentication | present in nonzero/hash-gated mode; zero/non-hash mode reaches writer directly |
| pathname value vs object/bytes | same stored pathname value; object and byte identity unknown because of independent reopen |
| package source vs transformed/final partition | no binding proved |
| image-backed vs clone | distinct writer branches |
| process completion vs cryptographic readback | distinct; completion is not readback authentication |
| inactive target vs bootloader activation | target selection machinery present; exact runtime-record assignment incomplete; activation/mark-good unknown |
| destination re-verification | no direct edge to the five inventoried helpers in the three reviewed post-write FDEs; broader absence unknown |
| write/update success | unknown |
| boot acceptance, root, persistence | all unknown |
