# Attack-surface prioritisation for the `260128` bench unit

Status: historical prioritisation, corrected 2026-11-01 with current recovery
and kernel evidence. No physical-device interaction. For the current finding
inventory use `evidence/exploit-inventory.md`.

## Former blocking dependency — resolved offline

The original encrypted-payload blocker no longer applies. The EU `260128`
payloads were recovered and the authentic userspace now boots in the isolated
VM. This enables exact userland and module review, but does not provide an OEM
signature bypass, installed-device execution, or evidence about the owner's
unknown installed firmware.

## Ranked routes

### 1. CVE-2026-40225 udev hardware-property injection — strongest static physical root path

- Exact shipped `v4l_id` and `scsi_id` binaries contain the
  direct, pre-fix prints of kernel-provided product/serial fields without the
  control-character checks added upstream in 2026.
- Installed rules import both helpers. Block devices are tagged for systemd and
  the image contains `debug-shell.service`, configured to start `/bin/sh` as
  root on `/dev/tty9` if `ConditionPathExists=/dev/tty9` passes. The upstream
  SCSI route can inject `SYSTEMD_WANTS`, so no new unit file is required.
- This is independent of V-006's blocked shell interpolation: it uses different
  helpers and property boundaries, not sanitized `usb_id` `ID_SERIAL_SHORT`.
- A fixed benign parser control retained the leading-space second property. A
  matched synthetic-event VM control then used exact `systemd-udevd` and PID 1
  systemd: only the positive `SYSTEMD_WANTS` property started the transient
  marker unit; the negative run did not. Shipped vulnerable helper rules were
  masked and no pre-existing property-selected unit was requested. Another control confirmed
  `/dev/tty9` exists as character device `4:9`; it did not start the shell unit.
  Remaining gates are malicious supported hardware, hardware bytes reaching the
  shipped helper, and a practical production VT9/display/input route.
  No head-unit event, root transition, or physical console access was observed.
- Evidence: `evidence/systemd-udev-cve-2026-40225.md`.

### 2. BusyBox CVE-2015-9261 — exact pre-auth removable-update parser defect

- AppScomoDM's recovered USB path examines one first iterator result matching
  `S5W_SYSTEM_*_*_*.zip`, then invokes bare `unzip` to extract `AppUpgrade` and
  `.lge.upgrade.xml` before authenticating either extracted member.
- Original `/usr/bin/unzip -> /bin/busybox` resolves to stock SHA-256
  `95bab633...bd9ebc`, BusyBox 1.23.2. Independent review found that the 1.35.0
  file under the current integrated tree is a VM-injected helper; it is excluded
  from stock conclusions.
- Exact stock `unzip` accepts methods 0/8 and rejects method 12. Method 8 reaches
  dynamic `huft_build`, whose exact `v+n` cursor bound at `0x4788a` can read an
  uninitialized `v[]` slot at `0x47938`; initial fix
  `1de25a6e87e0e627aa34298105a3d17c60a1f44e` and corrective sentinel
  follow-up `6bd3fff51aa74e2ee2d87887b12182a3b09792ef` are absent.
- The configured launcher context defaults to uid 0 and intended policy labels
  AppScomoDM `App::upgrade`. Runtime route selection, inherited `PATH`, process
  identity/label, and the owner's installed hash remain physical-state gates.
- No ZIP/DEFLATE fixture was made and no target ran. The strongest supported
  impact is likely `unzip` child crash/update DoS; no memory write, RCE, root,
  signature bypass, package acceptance, partition write, or persistence was
  demonstrated.
- Evidence: `evidence/busybox-unzip-cve-2015-9261.md`.

### 3. ConnMan DHCPv6 DOMAIN_LIST overwrite — strongest static adjacent-network candidate

- Exact RPM metadata identifies `connman-1.29+5w.master.38-r1`, but the finding
  does not rely on that version. Exact shipped instructions at `connmand+0x1f150`
  implement CVE-2026-115863's fixed 1,025-byte copy and unbounded DNS-label
  cursor/store; option-24 dispatch is exact at `+0x1f211`.
- Exact control flow also closes the main static activation question: on a
  connected managed network, RA Managed/Other flags reach stateful DHCPv6 or
  information-request startup, and the information path explicitly requests
  DOMAIN_LIST option 24.
- The installed service defaults to uid 0 and does not exclude intended `wlan0`.
  A reply must still match live transaction, client/server identity, message
  type, and state. Production IPv6/interface state and physical on-link delivery
  are unknown.
- PIE, NX stack, stack canary, full RELRO, and `Restart=on-failure` constrain the
  practical result. No packet, crash, controlled execution, or root transition
  has been demonstrated. Treat this as a disconnected-bench validation target,
  not network-to-root.
- Evidence: `evidence/connman-cve-2026-115863.md`.

A second exact ConnMan result, V-016/CVE-2023-28488, is **not** ranked as a root
candidate. Ordinary IPv4 startup does reach its pre-fix L2 total-length path,
but this exact build calls `__memcpy_chk` with the 628-byte object size and exact
libc reaches `__chk_fail` before an underflowed copy. Its strongest current
classification is conditional adjacent-network service termination/availability,
not memory corruption or code execution. See
`evidence/connman-cve-2023-28488.md`.

### 4. oFono TPDU and QMI bounds — strongest static cellular/modem candidates

- V-017 exact shipped instructions retain the destination checks fixed by
  CVE-2023-4232 through CVE-2023-4235, CVE-2023-2794, and CVE-2024-7547. This
  is exact-code evidence, not an inference from the old package label.
- Compiled `lgeqmimodem` callbacks pass direct indications and stored/raw-read
  TPDUs into incoming decoding. Deliver, submit-report, and status-report writes
  complete before the handler's late DELIVER type check. Deliver-report and
  command are outgoing-only, with exact local transmit-queue and SIM-Toolkit
  callers rather than the ordinary incoming SMS callback.
- V-018 separately retains CVE-2024-7537 in the QMI WMS message-list callback.
  Its 32-bit overflow diagnostic falls through to a four-byte allocation while
  a copy loop uses the original count. That input is modem-originated metadata,
  not a TPDU and not
  proven directly controllable by an SMS sender or base station.
- Message-free exhaustive models confirm writes beyond the relevant objects.
  No dynamic crash or control-flow result is claimed.
- The conditional service defaults to uid 0 and is assigned SMACK `App::tms`.
  Telematics/no-ISA markers, unit enablement, modem/QMI state, byte preservation,
  SIM-Toolkit state, owner-device applicability, RCE, SMACK escape, and
  unrestricted root remain unknown.
- Evidence: `evidence/ofono-sms-decoder-cves.md` and
  `evidence/ofono-qmi-message-list-cve-2024-7537.md`.

### 5. USB storage via AppNavi replacement — published but installation-gated

- Mechanism: `navi_extended` replaces `AppNavi`; on launch it runs
  `main_loop.sh` from the root of an exFAT USB.
- Why first: it is the only published mechanism that yields arbitrary code
  execution on Gen5W_L, and it is a *storage* vector, matching the requested
  scope.
- Gate: Engineering Mode. Two layers on `MASS_PRODUCT` — an SOP check that
  fires before the PIN, then QML PINs `21`/`11`. Documented alternates: UART,
  GDS, older build.
- Unknown: whether `260128` still accepts the replacement, and whether the SOP
  gate can be cleared without already having execution.

### 6. Other Wi-Fi/network daemon candidates — exact review rejects two P2P CVEs

The recovered RPM Btree contains 1,679 records and identifies, among others,
`wpa-supplicant-2.5+56-r1`, `busybox-1.23.2-r0mango12`,
`dropbear-2020.81-r8mango2`, and `openssl-1.0.2k-r0`. V-020 still illustrates
why records are only leads, but in the opposite direction from the first draft:
the stock 1.23.2 bytes had to be separated from a VM-injected 1.35.0 helper
before exact CVE-2015-9261 review. Exact review of
wpa_supplicant, SHA-256
`6ad96a34c09b66c29ed2f9ad7ae73dee8389c81064a30dfd36a1212c52a21212`,
shows why these package labels are leads rather than verdicts: its
`p2p_add_device()` gates the SSID copy on length at most 32, fixing
CVE-2015-1863, and its Provision Discovery Request handler unconditionally
re-fetches the peer after `p2p_add_device()`, fixing CVE-2021-27803.

P2P remains compiled into wpa_supplicant and ConnMan, and an enabled path unit
conditionally starts `supplicantmanager` when `/tmp/no_unece` exists. Production
marker state, arguments, interface ownership, P2P find/listen state, and radio
reachability are unknown. These two CVEs are rejected for recovered `260128`;
Dropbear's exact activation review is also complete for the recovered image:
its package record, socket-fed template, installer, and static root authorized
public key remain, but `dropbear`/`dropbearmulti`, the socket unit, host-key
service/key, and enable links are absent. It is dormant, not a listener or
version-derived CVE route. Remaining BusyBox, OpenSSL, and other daemon
candidates still require exact file, activation, listener, and route review.
ConnMan's `--nodnsproxy`, for example, removes older DNS-proxy CVE routes even
when package-age matching suggests them.

`tools/uk_fw/rpm_nvra_inventory.py` deterministically parses preserved
`db_dump -p` output. `tools/uk_fw/net_surface.py` remains the physical-bench
listener and banner capture tool. No public end-to-end Wi-Fi-to-root for this
Gen5W_L build has been established.

### 7. Bluetooth BSA BNEP — exact parser defect, but recovered PAN configuration is dormant

Both PCB-selected daemons contain CVE-2017-0782's pre-fix
`bnep_process_control_packet()` control flow. They read the BNEP extension and
control fields before the field-by-field remaining-length checks added by public
fix `1b08775917413f1674882130a948add1ae44cc91`; the same code exists in
`BSA0107_00.51.00` and `BSA0107_00.63.00`. `vbtd.service` is enabled, has a
configured uid-0 default, restarts always, and recovered policy intends
`App::bluetooth`; mandatory `/tmp/session_appmgr.env` is a runtime gate.

Both engineering profiles explicitly say `PAN : N/A`. Startup calls
`BNEP_Init`, but bounded review found no direct `BNEP_Register` reference. This
is V-019, dormant/conditionally reachable exact code—not a radio-to-root result.
An indirect/runtime profile registration would still need an active adapter,
accepted ACL/L2CAP channel, and parser delivery. Pairing/authorization,
allocation-bound OOB, disclosure, write primitive, RCE, and owner applicability
remain unknown. See
`evidence/broadcom-bsa-bluetooth-cves.md`.

### 8. USB gadget / iAP2 / CarPlay — recovered, parser review still needed

Kernel config enables `USB_F_IAP2`, `USB_U_IAP2`, `USB_G_SERIAL`,
`GADGETFS`, `USB_F_MASS_STORAGE`, `USB_DWC3` dual-role. These are modules and the
userspace has now been recovered. iAP2 is a bounded, length-prefixed protocol
parser and remains an exact-code review target; no
finding has yet been established.
Note: `CONFIG_LGE_CARPLAY=y` in the kernel, yet no `carplay` symbols exist in
`vmlinux`, so the parsing is userland.

### 8.5. AppLauncher on-demand D-Bus launch — strongest post-local-execution domain-amplification candidate

V-028 corrects a literal-path-only negative. Exact `com.lge.avn.applauncher` Request adaptor code accepts runtime `applocation`, forwards it to dispatcher `[0x1ffd0,0x205b3)`, overwrites AppProcess program field `+0x58`, sets direct-launch byte `+0x1c`, and reaches a `QProcess::start` call site without either identified verifier call. The new-object helper checks only appid range and path existence before construction; a relevant existing appid object skips those create gates. Runtime Request registration, object construction, QProcess acceptance, successful exec and resulting privilege/label remain separate gates.

This does not yet outrank V-014 as a physical entry because it starts after local code execution. It is stronger than the V-012 service-restart amplifier if its runtime gates hold: the private session bus defaults to the daemon's uid, many HMI applications/services are configured uid zero but SMACK-separated, and effective bus/socket/target labels remain unobserved. Prioritize passive installed hash, service/unit state, AppLauncher/caller uid and labels, `/tmp/session_appmgr{,.env}` metadata, and target-path execute access; leave service-name ownership and Request registration unknown because the probe does not connect to the bus. Do not send a launch request on the owner unit. See `evidence/applauncher-dbus-launch-bypass.md`.

### 9. Kernel — analysed; conditional post-execution candidates remain

- 64,923 symbols recovered and cross-validated (4,369/4,375 exports exact).
- 41 priority functions decompiled with corrected names.
- Trust chain: `verify_oem_signature` → SHA-256 → `manifest_key_verify_digest`
  → keyring lookup + usage bits → asymmetric verify. Reachable only from
  `keystore_backup` and `keystore_generate_mkey`, not exported.
- **Firmware acceptance is a userland decision.** A kernel signature bypass is
  not required to install a modified package.
- `/dev/keystore` (26 ioctls) is defensively coded: size gate, overflow-checked
  user pointers, matching alloc/copy lengths, post-dispatch zeroing. No
  memory-safety defect found in the reviewed set.
- Open question that matters: `keystore_open` has **no capability check**. If
  the device node is world-accessible and SMACK-permitted, any process can issue
  keystore ioctls, including `BACKUP` (which requires an OEM signature) and the
  `RUN_TESTS` path. Device-node mode and label are inside the encrypted rootfs.
- Built-in reachable code: netfilter/xtables (1,610 symbols), TCP (588),
  IPv6 (525), CAN (306, including `micom_*`), UDP (161).
- Exact checks reject CVE-2015-7613, CVE-2016-0728, physical USB-MIDI
  CVE-2016-2384, CVE-2016-7117, CVE-2017-7533, CVE-2017-8890, CVE-2017-11176, Dirty COW,
  both ranked AF_PACKET races, CVE-2017-7308's published private-area
  primitive, ALSA PCM CVE-2017-0861, and the generic missing Stack Clash
  guard-gap premise despite the old banner. The three newer built-in checks
  establish pre-publication SysV initialization, pre-`fput` `recvmmsg` error
  storage, and child multicast-list clearing. Exact `snd-seq.ko` rejects
  CVE-2016-2544, and exact `snd-timer.ko` carries CVE-2016-2545 through
  CVE-2016-2548 list-state, ioctl-serialization, and slave-locking fixes;
  CVE-2016-2549's provider is absent. CVE-2016-2384's
  modules and physical probe surface exist, but exact post-registration endpoint
  failures return without the second object free. CVE-2017-11176 is a
  semantic-control-flow result: the
  return-one retry lacks an explicit socket-register clear, but failed retry
  lookup routes to skb-only cleanup and cannot pass the stale socket to detach.
  CVE-2017-7533 is also rejected semantically: exact parent and rename paths
  stabilize both inline and external dentry names before the separate inotify
  length/copy operations.
  The companion AF_PACKET frame-count multiplication guard is absent, but the
  exact V1/V2 consumer trace is now complete. Allocation uses the full block
  count, and every position bounded by wrapped `frame_max` remains inside the
  allocated vector and block, including wrapped count zero. Separate mmap size
  wrap reaches exact `vm_insert_page` VMA rejection. This is a correctness and
  early-rejection gap, not a demonstrated OOB/root path. A distinct
  three signed vector-index residuals begin at block count `0x80000001`; the
  weakest `free_pg_vec` route needs only a strictly-greater-than-16-GiB vector
  plus an early block failure; `packet_set_ring` needs the preceding
  `0x80000000` blocks, and mmap needs successful publication of the whole ring. Allocator feasibility is
  unproved and these are not attributable solely to the missing guard.
- V-022/CVE-2018-17182 is exact pre-fix code on an ordinary MMU/thread surface:
  32-bit generations wrap into a live single-user flush helper that can retain
  cache pointers, and lookup validates only the same 32-bit generation. Public
  impact includes possible privilege gain. It requires a 2^32-state cycle and
  careful lifetime conditions; no target wrap, stale VMA, controlled reuse,
  corruption, or root is established. This is the highest-priority remaining
  local-kernel escalation candidate for a disposable instrumented environment,
  not the owner unit.
- V-029/CVE-2017-9242 is exact pre-fix IPv6 append-data ordering on an ordinary
  UDPv6 call path: skb allocation and the fraggap copy precede the signed
  remaining-copy rejection. It is a strong static local memory-corruption/DoS
  candidate, but required internal state, actual overwrite, controlled bytes,
  code execution and root are unobserved. Keep below V-022 as a root candidate
  until a disposable instrumented kernel establishes more than public crash/DoS.
- V-027/CVE-2020-29660 is an exact TTY session-pointer locking defect, but the
  authoritative four-byte disclosure description names `PREEMPT=y` and this
  build has only voluntary preemption. Keep as conditional information
  disclosure below V-024 unless runtime evidence or disposable-kernel analysis
  establishes a realizable harmful overlap.
- V-026/CVE-2017-10661 is an exact built-in timerfd race premise requiring no
  device/module/namespace. Same-context membership transitions lack the fixed
  per-context lock, but public impact is more clearly list corruption/DoS than
  privilege gain. Keep below V-022 through V-025 until disposable sanitizer
  work can establish an actual invariant violation.
- V-025/CVE-2021-0920 is an exact AF_UNIX local candidate. Both MSG_PEEK
  attached-file receive paths omit the GC serialization added upstream, and
  recovered D-Bus usage makes runtime module loading plausible. Confirm
  `/proc/modules`, exact module hash, uid/SMACK, and limits passively; GC overlap,
  UAF, corruption, and root remain unproved.
- V-024/CVE-2020-29661 is an exact local TTY candidate. Master- and slave-side
  setters update one referenced slave pgrp field under distinct object locks;
  SMP is enabled and startup intends `/dev/ptmx` mode `0666`. Runtime node,
  mount, SMACK, job-control, successful concurrency, UAF, and root remain
  unobserved. Capture the newly added passive PTY metadata before any testing.
- V-023/CVE-2018-18281 is a second ordinary-MMU candidate. Exact PTE transfer
  releases both bound page-table locks before the only old-range TLB flush.
  Turning that window into stale page access requires concurrent invalidation,
  page release/reuse, and suitable timing; none is observed. Prioritize exact
  feasibility study beside V-022 in a disposable instrumented kernel, without
  treating the static window as corruption or root.
- V-013/CVE-2017-15265 remains pre-fix in exact `snd-seq.ko`; a benign VM
  diagnostic confirmed uid/gid-65534 create/delete ioctl reachability, but a
  bounded race did not fault and no root primitive is established.
- V-021 is an exact conditional local information disclosure: one
  `snd_timer_user_tinterrupt` path omits initialization of eight ABI padding
  bytes that the queue and read code copy in full. Intended DAC is `0644`, but
  module load, effective SMACK, provider/event generation, and owner-build
  identity remain unobserved. It is a possible information-leak component, not
  root or code execution.
- ALSA sequencer CVE-2018-1000004 lacks the official ioctl serialization, but
  the published pool sequence requires a write-capable sequencer fd and
  recovered intended policy grants ordinary users no write permission.
- CVE-2017-1000112's IPv4/IPv6 UFO guards are absent, but
  `CONFIG_USER_NS=n` blocks the published unprivileged root setup and production
  interface UFO features are unknown.

### 10. MICOM / CAN — post-exploitation

`micom_*` (24 symbols) includes a user-writable sysfs handler
(`micom_sys_spidump_store`). CVE-2020-8539 (`micomd`) is a **local** issue:
the public KOFFEE report confirms it needs code execution first, then reaches
`/dev/socket/micomd` to emit M-CAN frames. Not an entry vector.

## What is not available

- No public Wi-Fi-to-root for Gen5W_L.
- No public copy of the Chimaera report or tooling (the IIT host is unreachable;
  only the 2024 journal version, DOI `10.1007/s11416-024-00522-4`, and the CVE
  records are readable). The KOFFEE report *was* recovered via the Wayback
  Machine.
- No evidence that `260128` retains the `211214` bypasses.
- No public end-to-end validation of the `navi_extended` chain on physical
  hardware.

## Decisive next evidence, in order

1. Preserve V-014's remaining helper-input, physical-port, production-tty, and
   display/input gates for a disconnected bench with a benign marker—not the
   installed shell unit. Parser and synthetic udevd-to-systemd semantics are
   complete; do not describe them as physical-device reproduction.
2. For V-020, passively record installed BusyBox/AppScomoDM hashes, the
   `/usr/bin/unzip` provider, effective `PATH`, SCOMO/FUMO selection, and runtime
   uid/SMACK label. Do not place a malformed update archive on the owner unit;
   reserve sanitizer fixtures for a disposable vendor regression environment.
3. For V-015 and V-016, preserve the current NIC-free VM. On a disconnected
   bench, first record installed `connmand` and libc hashes, interface ownership,
   IPv4/IPv6 state, and benign DHCP/RA behavior. Do not move to a malformed
   control unless restart and recovery are proven, and do not develop a
   privilege payload. Exact fortification already constrains V-016 to an abort
   before the reviewed copy.
4. For V-017, record installed `ofonod`, unit/marker state, uid/SMACK label,
   modem devices, QMI services, and benign SMS behavior before any malformed
   control. Treat any later test as crash-only on a disconnected disposable
   state; do not develop a payload.
5. Identify an authentic post-index caller of V-012 playback or MediaBrowser's
   explicit `requestThumbnails(as)`, and repair the bounded VM thumbnail
   service-name/delivery boundary. Exact static code maps that request to
   `VideoContext → uridecodebin → eligible asfdemux`, while LightMediaScanner
   startup indexing uses a separate non-GStreamer ASF plugin. Manual authentic
   PlayerEngine D-Bus reachability is proven, but no automatic media-to-root path
   or RCE is established. Do not prioritize VMNC CVE-2016-9445/9446: exact
   every feasible WMVi path in the recovered code passes the 16384 dimension
   checks before dispatch, and the allocation uses `g_malloc0`, despite its
   `1.8.3-r0` metadata.
6. Determine production DAC/SMACK access to `/dev/snd/seq` and analyze V-013's
   first post-free use without attempting or claiming a root exploit.
7. Measure production interface features before treating CVE-2017-1000112 as a
   reachable path; keep the current VM NIC-free.
8. If physical bench access later becomes available, capture UART and installed
   version state before any write or engineering-mode experiment.
