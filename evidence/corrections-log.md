# Corrections log

Every claim this programme got wrong, what replaced it, and why. The changelog is
chronological; this is claim-oriented, so a reader landing on an older evidence
document knows whether to trust it.

Read this before quoting any evidence document.

**2026-10-21 scope warning:** C1–C11 preserve earlier correction entries, some
of which still overstate what their evidence establishes. In particular, C3/C4
are family/field-report claims, not installed-unit validation; C6/C10 do not
prove encryption boundaries; C11 does not prove all offline analysis impossible.
Use the current VM/recovery notes and C12–C14 below for those boundaries.

---

## C1 — Kernel symbol table was mispaired by 204 entries

- **Was:** 64,923 symbols recovered and applied to Ghidra; 48 security functions
  decompiled and named.
- **Now:** the address array start was taken at the first *kernel-range* pointer,
  so leading absolute (`A`) symbols were skipped and **every** symbol was paired
  with an address 204 entries away. Prologues still looked plausible, so the
  error was invisible.
- **Why:** cross-check against `__ksymtab` showed a constant −204 shift on 4,347
  of 4,375 exports. Fixed in `tools/uk_fw/kallsyms_structural.py`; the corrected
  table matches 4,369/4,375 exports exactly with zero mismatches.
- **Affected documents:** `eu-kernel-decompilation.md`,
  `eu-kernel-symbol-recovery-and-trust-chain.md` (the latter is correct).
  Any function-level claim resting on the original naming should be re-derived.

## C2 — Boot container field `0x18` is not a checksum

- **Was:** treated as a possible CRC covering some region; zlib and
  CRC-32/MPEG-2 hypotheses were tested and failed.
- **Now:** it is a **constant format/build id** (`0x42f08d94`), identical across
  all six `iasImage*_sub` variants whose command lines differ. It cannot be
  content-derived.
- **Why:** comparing the six variants directly.

## C3 — `mmcblk0p3` / `mmcblk0p5` are A/B system partitions, not display variants

- **Was:** interpreted as two root selections tied to 1280 vs 1920 display models.
- **Now:** they are the **A/B system partition pair** of one device family. The
  update writes to the inactive partition and rewrites `/etc/fstab`.
- **Why:** the public `wideopen` wiki's update-process description plus the
  patcher's A/B handling.

## C4 — Downgrade is not blocked

- **Was:** the `>=` version check blocks downgrade on the Linux path.
- **Now:** the version gate is a single userland comparison, and the public
  `navi_extended` FAQ documents substitution — older official payloads paired
  with the **latest** `.lge.upgrade.xml` for the same vehicle, so a genuine signed
  newer manifest satisfies the check. The Android sibling differs: its signed
  `update_info` binds the package, which is why the EV6 report failed.
- **Why:** child note 10 plus the tracker evidence.
- **Caveat:** three non-cryptographic obstacles remain (feed, target build,
  unconfirmed on 2026 packages).

## C5 — The `.ver` CRC hypothesis is weaker than first stated

- **Was:** if the upgrader relied on the `.ver` CRC, a CRC-repaired payload would
  pass and custom firmware would need no key.
- **Now:** the arithmetic stands — CRC-32 is forgeable and `crc32_forge.py`
  demonstrates it. The *exploitable* reading is weakened: a public report
  describes repairing CRC **and** size and being rejected, so at least one further
  check exists. Also, `.ver` values cover **ciphertext**, so modification still
  requires the key.
- **Why:** community field evidence (child note 10 / `community-field-evidence.md`).

## C6 — Header entropy was misread

- **Was:** the 3,385-byte boot-image header looked "structured" at entropy ~5.7.
- **Now:** 6.0 is the maximum for a 64-byte block, so ~5.7 means **random**. The
  header is encrypted, not plaintext metadata.
- **Why:** recomputing entropy correctly. The region contains no little-endian
  copy of 6,210,308 / 3,385 / 13,035 / 52 / 953 / `0x42f08d94`.

## C7 — The `DecryptToPIPE` invocation was guessed, and guessed wrong

- **Was:** `gen5w_decrypt.py` defaulted to `DecryptToPipe {input} {output}` and
  assumed the package footer had to be stripped first.
- **Now:** the documented invocation is
  `DecryptToPIPE -d <keyfile> <input> 0 > <output>`. Output is on stdout, and the
  whole file — footer included — is handed over; nothing is stripped.
- **Why:** the public `update_decryptor` Dockerfile and `entrypoint.sh`.

## C8 — An attempted vulnerability was rejected

- **Was (hypothesis):** `KEYSTORE_IOC_TEST_VERIFY_ECC_SIGNATURE` (0x412037c9)
  left its tail fields uninitialised because the ioctl declared only 32 bytes.
- **Now:** rejected. Decoded size is `0x120` (288), which covers the offsets the
  handler reads. **Not a bug.**
- **Why:** decoding `_IOC` correctly instead of by eye. Recorded so it is not
  re-raised.

## C9 — A second attempted vulnerability was rejected

- **Was (hypothesis):** `keystore_get_ksm_key` zeroed one buffer then copied from
  another, suggesting an uninitialised-stack disclosure.
- **Now:** rejected at instruction level. The buffer is
  `[68-byte private][136-byte public]`; the code zeroes the private half and
  returns the public half. **Not a bug.** The earlier reading was a decompiler
  artefact.
- **Why:** disassembling the function rather than trusting Ghidra's variable
  sizing.

## C10 — The `iasImage` decomposition replaced an earlier, vaguer note

- **Was:** "16,420 bytes larger than `_sub`, five of six share a 13,035-byte
  trailer."
- **Now:** exact — `3,385 header + 6,210,308 payload + 13,035 trailer =
  6,226,728`, where the payload length equals the plaintext `_sub` size.
- **Why:** arithmetic closes exactly.

## C11 — A "kernel IAS driver" does not exist

- **Was (hope):** the `ipk.`/`iasImage` format might be handled by Linux and
  therefore analysable.
- **Now:** the kernel contains no IAS symbol, string or config option. The format
  is a **boot loader** concern; it cannot be analysed without an SPI dump.
- **Why:** symbol, string and config searches.

---

## C12 — VM impossibility, PCI enumeration and panic attribution

- **Was:** no usable block device or display path; a nearby keystore warning
  established an anti-tamper panic; successful synthetic inputs bypassed it.
- **Now:** the panic trace is a root-mount failure. QEMU SDHCI `1b36:0007`
  binds after an exact-build guest-RAM PCI-table adaptation, and a compatible
  ext4 root executes BusyBox. A userspace PCI-mapped VGA diagnostic displays
  verified pixels and accepts virtual keyboard events. Missing framebuffer
  support did not make all graphics impossible.
- **Boundary:** this is a VM-adapted vendor kernel and our research userland,
  not a recovered HMI or a boot-trust bypass. Synthetic initialization is not
  possession of device keys. Sparse logs did not prove failed PCI enumeration.
- **Evidence:** `vendor-kernel-vm.md`, `vendor-kernel-graphics.md` and fresh
  regressions in `local-ui-recovery.md`.

## C13 — Entropy, arithmetic and suffix equality do not decode an envelope

- **Was:** the 3,385/payload/13,035 split was an exact decoded layout; shared
  high-entropy suffixes were definitely encrypted descriptors; a decryptor
  must strip those suffixes; the unique prefix length was a plaintext length.
- **Now:** those interpretations exceed the measurements. Arithmetic and
  shared bytes do not establish fields, keys, signature coverage or acceptance.
  Finite-sample entropy does not distinguish encrypted data from other
  high-entropy content. The documented vendor CLI takes the **whole input**,
  as already noted in C7. `eu-ota-container-structure.md` now says so directly.
- **Boundary:** no current payload format or authentic decryption is recovered.

## C14 — Local recovery negatives must retain their search bounds

- **Was:** broad claims that no package key material or offline avenue exists.
- **Now:** the new public-RSA probe finds no type-1 block under the boot key
  in the recorded edges of 38 files. Two statically reconstructed Mac updater
  AES pairs yield no validated plaintext in the tested CBC hypotheses. Two
  gzip-marker matches fail reserved-flag/zlib checks. Positive controls pass.
- **Boundary:** other keys, encodings, locations and derivations are untested.
  The Mac updater's text/API crypto is not established firmware crypto. REA
  Mach-O inspection succeeded; its deep Ghidra function analysis timed out,
  so function claims here use explicitly identified LLVM disassembly instead.
- **Evidence:** `local-ui-recovery.md`, retained reports and 13 new RSA-probe
  unit tests. No new Fable/Council acceptance is claimed.

---

## C15 — D-Bus transition result `255` is not sufficient to call the request rejected

- **Was:** the immediate `/transition` out value `255` was treated as a
  rejection/non-success result, even after the standby state changed.
- **Now:** it is not a completion verdict in isolation. In the corroborated
  post-agreement run, the same immediate value is followed by
  `is_standby_agree_pressed ... result[1]`, exception-filter results zero,
  current AppID Home `11`, authentic Home response `ret[1]`, drawing AppID
  `11`, IVI foreground of surface `1001`, and visibly composed Home pixels.
- **Why:** the full downstream asynchronous manager/application/IVI chain is
  stronger evidence than the method's immediate integer.
- **Boundary:** this does not assign an exact enum name to `255` and does not
  prove Home↔Navigation operation. Classify each request from downstream state
  and response evidence.
- **Evidence:** `HANDOVER.md`, `Ioniq5-CHANGELOG.md` 0.44.0, and archive SHA-256
  `87d81b278f8b1bb20236faedd17dda0493b49b6cfc1e0fd2f1acfe8b8d2c6f5e`.

---

## C16 — V-006's unquoted root shell sink is not descriptor-based command injection

- **Was:** static review stopped at `util_replace_whitespace()` and concluded that
  USB serial punctuation, `${IFS}`, separators and redirects reached
  `/app/bin/usb-automount` unchanged. V-006 was therefore labelled a confirmed
  CWE-78 USB-to-root path and a physical payload sequence was documented.
- **Now:** `builtin_usb_id` next calls `util_replace_chars(..., NULL)`. Its default
  allowlist is alphanumerics plus `#+-.:=@_`; other tested printable characters
  become `_`. QEMU `usb-mtp` exercised the authentic udev → root automounter →
  `system()` chain. The old payload was sanitized and no command executed.
- **Why:** the call at `0x1c33e` was misidentified as trimming rather than the
  security-relevant character filter. Static sink analysis omitted an upstream
  transformation at the trust boundary.
- **Boundary:** the shell construction is still unsafe and a leading `#` can
  disrupt it. Other firmware/udev builds and untested property paths require
  separate validation. Physical-head-unit parity is unverified.
- **Evidence:** `v006-exploit-host.log` SHA-256
  `568f3197ff178cbf8356674c74a149b66ec1bfd96eedd5f2098a830c84adb27a`;
  sanitizer matrix SHA-256
  `de0757442ca4a74d3a3f87db79e8c3eb2b16b101dc47131d266af71ac734b0a1`;
  `Ioniq5-VULNERABILITIES.md` V-006.

---

## C17 — Missing `MS_NODEV` does not mean every USB image can carry a live device node

- **Was:** the confirmed absence of `MS_NODEV` was immediately described as a
  first-ranked path where “any normal image containing `mknod` nodes” exposes raw
  internal block devices.
- **Now:** the automounter constructs vendor filesystem names `tntfs`/`texfat`;
  other types become literal `mtp`. FAT/exFAT do not natively encode POSIX device
  inodes. Whether a special-file encoding produced on NTFS is materialized as a
  device by this exact Tuxera module is untested. Even if it is, a local process
  must still open and use the node; the node does not execute from USB.
- **Why:** mount flags establish policy, not on-disk filesystem semantics or an
  execution trigger. Those are separate reachability steps.
- **Boundary at correction time:** omitting `MS_NODEV` remained a real hardening
  error and V-011 became a post-execution/DAC-bypass candidate, not a
  stock-to-root claim. The harmless dynamic test has since been completed; see
  C21.

---

## C18 — The `4.1.27-abl` banner does not make Dirty COW present

- **Was:** CVE-2016-5195 was ranked as the leading post-execution local-root
  candidate because upstream Linux 4.1 did not receive the fix until 4.1.35.
- **Now:** the recovered vendor binary contains the fix's paired invariants:
  `follow_page_mask` requires `FOLL_FORCE | FOLL_COW` and a dirty PTE before
  following a forced write PTE, while `__get_user_pages` sets `FOLL_COW` after
  the COW fault. The vulnerable `FOLL_WRITE`-clearing sequence is not used.
- **Why:** the original ranking was version-gap triage and explicitly did not
  confirm vendor cherry-picks. Exact binary inspection now supplies that check.
- **Boundary:** this rejects Dirty COW only for recovered EU `260128`; it does
  not validate other kernel CVEs or the owner's unknown installed build.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-dirty-cow-backport.md`.

---

## C19 — Both ranked AF_PACKET races are backported in the shipped module

- **Was:** the TPACKET_V3 version-change and `PACKET_RESERVE` races remained
  ranked as AF_PACKET local-root hypotheses based on upstream fix dates.
- **Now:** shipped `af_packet.ko` acquires the socket lock at the start of
  `packet_set_ring`, locks the `PACKET_VERSION` branch around ring checks and
  `tp_version`, and separately locks the `PACKET_RESERVE` branch around ring
  checks and `tp_reserve`. These are the changes from upstream commits
  `84ac7260236a` and `c27927e372f0`.
- **Why:** as with Dirty COW, a base version identifies candidates but cannot
  establish that an OEM kernel omitted a backport.
- **Boundary:** this rejects CVE-2016-8655 and CVE-2017-1000111 only; other
  AF_PACKET bugs and actual
  `CAP_NET_RAW` assignments need separate checks.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-af-packet-backport.md`.

---

## C20 — The larger Stack Clash guard gap is present despite the old banner

- **Was:** CVE-2017-1000364 remained the leading version-derived local-root
  hypothesis after Dirty COW and the AF_PACKET races were rejected.
- **Now:** the vendor binary contains `vm_start_gap`, `stack_guard_gap`, its boot
  parameter parser, and an initialized 1 MiB gap. Those are the central changes
  from upstream commit `1be7107fbe18`.
- **Why:** ranking by the upstream stable version again missed an OEM backport.
- **Boundary:** the larger gap is mitigation rather than a proof against every
  stack-growth technique, but the generic missing-fix premise is false here.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-stack-guard-backport.md`.

---

## C21 — Exact Tuxera NTFS does preserve usable special-node semantics

- **Was:** after C17, Tuxera NTFS special-file materialization and the practical
  effect of `nodev` remained unverified.
- **Now:** exact `tntfs` `3016.7.1.2.3` retained an inert character node (`1:3`)
  across unmount/remount. Without `nodev`, numeric uid/gid 65534 under SMACK `_`
  opened it read-only; with `nodev`, the same open failed with `EACCES`.
- **Why:** filesystem semantics must be measured separately from mount-flag
  recovery. The test used only QEMU `/dev/null` and a disposable NTFS image.
- **Boundary:** this confirms a device-policy bypass primitive, not USB-to-root.
  A production local opener, useful major/minor, access mode and SMACK/path
  permission are still required.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/usb-root-test-plan.md` and the hashes recorded there.

---

## C22 — Enabled keyrings do not make CVE-2016-0728 present

- **Was:** CVE-2016-0728 remained a local-root candidate because
  `CONFIG_KEYS=y`, the vulnerable-era API exists, and the base version predates
  its upstream stable fix.
- **Now:** exact `join_session_keyring` disassembly releases the lookup reference
  when the located keyring equals the new credentials' current session keyring.
  This is the complete operation added by upstream commit `23567fd052a9`.
- **Why:** subsystem enablement and version range establish reachability for
  triage, not the absence of a vendor backport.
- **Boundary:** this rejects CVE-2016-0728 only. It does not validate unrelated
  keyring lifetime or permission paths.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-keyring-backport.md`.

---

## C23 — Read-only ALSA sequencer ioctl access does not expose every sequencer race

- **Was:** once V-013 proved uid/gid-65534 create/delete ioctl reachability on
  `/dev/snd/seq`, nearby sequencer CVEs could appear equally reachable.
- **Now:** exact `snd-seq.ko` lacks CVE-2018-1000004's official Linux 4.1 ioctl
  serialization, but its published pool sequence requires `write()` while
  recovered intended node policy is `root:root 0644`. The VM confirmed V-013
  ioctls through an `O_RDONLY` descriptor under that manually modeled mode, but
  an ordinary uid cannot obtain the write-capable descriptor needed by the
  sibling sequence.
- **Why:** device-node reachability is operation-specific; a readable ioctl
  surface does not confer file write access.
- **Boundary:** altered DAC, a passed write-capable fd, a privileged service, or
  different installed firmware could restore the precondition. The code should
  still be patched.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-alsa-follow-up-cves.md`.

---

## C24 — Public ASF source layout is not the exact vendor layout

- **Was:** the source-derived x86-64 `AsfStream` size was treated as 200 bytes,
  placing the 33rd stream's `pad` assignment directly over the live
  `GstFlowCombiner *` field.
- **Now:** exact shipped `libgstasf.so` instructions use a 208-byte (`0xd0`)
  stride and an additional 8 bytes before the pad field. For stream index 32,
  plugin offset `0x990d` zeros the low 32 bits of `flowcombiner`; the pad pointer
  instead overwrites the start of `old_stream[0]`.
- **Why:** the vendor plugin contains a layout-changing source modification not
  represented by the public GStreamer 1.8.3 header. Source is useful for naming
  behavior but cannot supply exact offsets for a modified binary.
- **Dynamic confirmation:** PlayerEngine catches signal 11 with
  `g_queue_push_head+0x1d <- libgstasf.so+0xb6cc`; exact code at
  `0xb6c0..0xb6c7` loads the corrupted `flowcombiner` and calls
  `gst_flow_combiner_add_pad`.
- **Boundary:** this establishes the first observed fatal corrupted use, not an
  attacker-selected pointer, instruction-pointer control, or RCE.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/gstreamer-cve-2026-2920.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/media-candidates/playerengine-asf-service-evidence.txt`.

---

## C25 — V-006's sanitizer does not sanitize every udev hardware helper

- **Was:** after V-006's `ID_SERIAL_SHORT` route was rejected, it was tempting to
  treat systemd-udev descriptor/property injection as generally blocked on this
  build.
- **Now:** CVE-2026-40225 crosses different helpers. Exact shipped `v4l_id` and
  `scsi_id` instructions print kernel-provided product/serial fields directly as
  line-oriented properties, without the control-character checks added by the
  2026 fix. Installed rules consume those properties, and an installed
  `debug-shell.service` makes the SCSI `SYSTEMD_WANTS` route security-relevant.
- **Why:** sanitization must be traced per property producer and consumer.
  `usb_id`'s restricted `ID_SERIAL_SHORT` does not transform `v4l_id` or
  `scsi_id` output.
- **Version boundary:** PID 1's compiled banner/pkg-config report systemd `225`,
  while embedded OpenEmbedded build paths say `systemd/1_249.3-r0`. The finding
  relies on exact helper instructions and rules, not either version string.
- **Dynamic refinement:** a fixed benign `udevadm test` control confirmed parser
  retention. Matched synthetic-add controls then showed exact udevd persisting
  the property and exact PID 1 systemd starting only the positive transient
  BusyBox marker unit; the negative run did not. Vulnerable helper rules were
  masked, and no pre-existing property-selected unit or shell was requested.
- **Evidence boundary:** no malicious physical-device event, shipped vulnerable
  helper execution, installed shell-unit request, or physical root transition
  has been observed. V-014 remains a high-confidence static physical path in
  recovered `260128`, with downstream synthetic semantics dynamically confirmed;
  it is not proof about the owner's
  unknown installed build.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/systemd-udev-cve-2026-40225.md`.

---

## C26 — Thumbnail `Start(as)` does not select the audio/TagLib path by extension

- **Was:** early exploratory thumbnail runs did not map `libgstasf`, and the
  `.wma` route was described as following the extractor's audio/TagLib path.
- **Now:** exact code shows `ThumbnailService::startExtractThumb()` queues every
  path and `StartThumbnail()` always obtains `VideoContext`. Its pipeline is
  `uridecodebin ... appsink`, and its custom autoplug callback does not reject
  `asfdemux`. The separate `AudioProcess` is used by the cover-art context.
- **Invocation boundary:** MediaBrowser exposes explicit CommonAPI
  `requestThumbnails(as)` and forwards it to the extractor's session-bus
  `Start(as)`. Reviewed scan-completed and media-file-found callbacks do not call
  this request path, so automatic scan-time or UI invocation is not established.
- **Dynamic boundary:** bounded VM attempts did not observe service-name
  acquisition, a delivered `Start`, `libgstasf` mapping, cache output, or a
  natural process crash. A no-reply `dbus-send` return code does not prove
  delivery. This is exact static routing evidence, not a thumbnail crash.
- **Evidence:**
  `evidence/artifacts/media-candidates/thumbnail-extractor-asf-route-evidence.txt`.

---

## C27 — Integrated `extracted-safe` BusyBox is a VM helper, not stock firmware

- **Was:** current `extracted-safe/mango-rootfs/bin/busybox`, SHA-256
  `6e123e7f...11348`, was treated as the original `/usr/bin/unzip` provider and
  its BusyBox 1.35.0 method-12 BZIP2 code was assigned to recovered `260128`.
- **Now:** VM integration preserved the original as `busybox.vendor`, removed
  that path, and hard-linked the static research helper from `work/vm/busybox`
  into `/bin/busybox`. Canonical stock bytes from the independent original
  extraction are SHA-256 `95bab633...bd9ebc`, BusyBox 1.23.2. Stock `unzip`
  accepts methods 0/8 and rejects method 12.
- **Replacement finding:** stock method 8 reaches exact pre-fix CVE-2015-9261
  `huft_build` before AppScomoDM authenticates either extracted member. The
  supported result is likely `unzip` child crash/update DoS, not the withdrawn
  method-12 allocation-relative write claim.
- **Additional corrections:** AppScomoDM's archive selector examines one first
  `QDirIterator` result rather than the last match. Exact Qt returns a normalized
  exit code; checking only bits 8–15 accepts every normal 0..255 exit code.
- **Why:** an offline extraction tree became a VM staging tree. Hard links and
  path names are not provenance; original archive/extraction identities must be
  rechecked before exact-binary conclusions.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/busybox-unzip-cve-2015-9261.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/update-candidates/busybox-unzip-cve-2015-9261-evidence.txt`.

---

## C28 — The published CVE-2017-7308 private-area primitive is backported, but one companion guard is absent

- **Was:** the AF_PACKET review rejected two race CVEs but explicitly left other
  TPACKET arithmetic defects unchecked.
- **Now:** exact `af_packet.ko` performs the CVE-2017-7308
  `BLK_PLUS_PRIV((u64)tp_sizeof_priv)` calculation in 64-bit registers before
  comparing it with block size, matching upstream fix `2b6867c2ce76`. The
  Project Zero private-area signedness/overflow primitive is therefore absent.
- **Residual:** the same exact function still performs
  `frames_per_block * tp_block_nr` in 32 bits without the companion
  `UINT_MAX / tp_block_nr` guard from `8f8d28e4d6d8`. Public-source follow-up
  found no standalone crash, corruption, escalation, or DoS assigned to the
  redundant TPACKET_V3 field. Exact V1/V2 paths share the multiplication and
  later retain `frame_max`, so their allocation/indexing consequences remain
  impact-unknown rather than being downgraded to hardening only.
- **Boundary:** all packet-socket paths still require `CAP_NET_RAW`, applicable
  ring-version reachability, and the owner's installed module identity. This does not reject
  unrelated AF_PACKET defects.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-af-packet-backport.md`.

---

## C29 — The FUMO encryption-mode byte does control one navigation signature gate

- **Was:** a separate Navi NUA signature path was noted, but the reviewed data
  flow had not shown `/update/disableEncryptionUpdate` controlling it.
- **Now:** exact inner-FUMO function `0x128070` tests the shared mode byte at
  `0x128940`. Byte zero logs the non-encrypted navigation-map signature skip and
  sets gate-complete byte `this+0xd5`. FUMO startup sets that mode byte to zero
  when `/update/disableEncryptionUpdate` exists.
- **Additional skip:** dedicated marker
  `/update/disableNaviMapSignatureCheck_20230207`, absent NaviUpdateApp/NUA
  provider, and no navigation-map candidate also complete this one gate without
  running its asynchronous verifier. The exact binary has only the existence
  check as a static reference to the dedicated marker literal; dynamic
  construction and other-process writers remain unexcluded.
- **Boundary:** this is a named navigation-map signature skip, not a universal
  package-signature or payload-acceptance bypass. Marker creation, outer FUMO
  contracts, version/model/region, non-map digests, writes, slot/boot trust,
  root, and persistence remain separate.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/appupgrade-update-trust.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/update-candidates/fumo-navi-signature-gate-evidence.txt`.

---

## C30 — `force_launch=run` does not itself establish completion

- **Was:** inner FUMO writer sites were known, but the completion-string
  provenance and authentication state preceding force-marker creation remained
  unnamed.
- **Now:** callback FDE `[0x11f1b0,0x120a9e)` attempts `processing` at
  progress zero and then `force_launch=run`; the branch-local progress-100
  sequence attempts `complete` and then force value `none`, while later
  scheduled flow can attempt `run` again. The weak writer does not prove full,
  successful, or atomic transitions. Exact `DeltaUpdateProgressHandler` and
  timer routes feed some callback events.
- **Boundary:** no named cryptographic result is read at the direct force-write
  sites, so the marker alone does not establish completion or authentication in
  this write-site evidence. This does not prove an unauthenticated package can
  generate a valid upstream progress event. The scheduled call site retains its
  separate two-completion-string and schedule-state conditions.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/appdmclient-fumo-usb-eligibility.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/update-candidates/fumo-progress-force-marker-evidence.txt`.

---

## C31 — Missing explicit `sock = NULL` opcode is not a missing CVE-2017-11176 fix

- **Tempting but wrong shortcut:** exact `sys_mq_notify` loops when
  `netlink_attachskb()` returns one without an explicit zeroing instruction for
  its socket register. Reading only that edge would classify the old kernel as
  pre-fix.
- **Exact result:** the callee first drops the socket reference, but both failed
  retry lookup paths jump directly to notification-skb cleanup at
  `0xffffffff811b18a4`. Neither can reach socket-detach cleanup at
  `0xffffffff811b1892` with the old pointer. That branch structure is
  machine-code-equivalent to upstream `sock = NULL`.
- **Conclusion:** CVE-2017-11176's stale-reference over-release is rejected for
  recovered `vmlinux` SHA-256 `f5ee9c2f...6b102b`, even though
  `CONFIG_POSIX_MQUEUE=y`. The conclusion does not cover unrelated mqueue or
  netlink defects or the owner's unknown installed kernel.

## C32 — Old USB-audio configuration does not imply CVE-2016-2384

- **Candidate:** the recovered kernel enables `CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m` and ships
  exact generic USB-audio and USB-MIDI modules, so descriptor-driven probe code
  is a genuine physical pre-login surface.
- **Exact result:** after `snd_rawmidi_new()` installs the private-free owner,
  every reviewed endpoint-creation failure branches directly to the error
  epilogue. None calls or inlines the second USB-MIDI object free removed by
  upstream `07d86ca93db7e5cdf4743564d98292042ec21af7`.
- **Conclusion:** CVE-2016-2384 is rejected for exact `snd-usbmidi-lib.ko`
  SHA-256 `ad2180ba...b434be`. This does not remove other USB parser candidates
  or prove production port/module state on the owner's unknown build.
- **Evidence:** `evidence/vendor-kernel-usb-midi-backport.md` and
  `evidence/artifacts/kernel-candidates/snd-usbmidi-cve-2016-2384.asm`.

## Standing practice that produced these corrections

1. Cross-check a symbol table against an independent table before trusting names.
2. Disassemble a function before calling a decompiler artefact a vulnerability.
3. Compute an entropy maximum before calling entropy "low".
4. Treat a field report as evidence against a hypothesis, not just for it.
5. Record rejected hypotheses, not only accepted findings.

Items C8 and C9 were never vulnerabilities; they are kept here because a reader
who finds the earlier reasoning in a draft should know it was tested and failed.
